# Jazzam - Audio Players Custom 

This project is a music application demo from scratch. Initially, I wanted to integrate an API. However, finding a free music API without query limitations is not easy.
Therefore, I developed the application using royalty-free music under the "Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)" license.

## Features

-   Custom slider
-   Custom audio player
-   Possibility to pause/play or skip to next/previous track
-   Possibility to switch playlists by clicking on a genre in the slider
-   Interaction between players, when a track ends the player closes and the next one opens automatically
-   Full responsive

## Technologies Used

-   **Vite**: A tool for fast build and development of modern web applications
-   **TypeScript**: A programming language that allows for better definition and verification of variable types
